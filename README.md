## Procedure for EndoScan-VLM: Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Detection of Endometriosis
### 1. Problem Definition

Endometriosis diagnosis is often delayed due to reliance on invasive laparoscopy.

Aim: Build a multimodal AI system that uses medical images (ultrasound/MRI) and patient symptom data (clinical notes, questionnaires) for early, non-invasive detection.

### 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing

Medical Images:

Collect anonymized pelvic MRI/ultrasound images.

Preprocess: resize, normalize, remove noise, and annotate with clinical labels (endometriosis present/absent, staging).

Symptom Data:

Gather structured inputs (pain scale, menstrual cycle patterns, infertility history).

Convert into machine-readable format (numerical vectors or embeddings).

Textual Data (if available):

Extract clinical notes/diagnosis reports.

Use NLP to clean, tokenize, and convert into embeddings (BERT/ClinicalBERT).

### 3. Model Architecture

Image Encoder

Use CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet) or vision transformers (ViT, Swin-Transformer) for MRI/ultrasound feature extraction.

Language Encoder

Use pretrained transformer (BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT) for symptom text and clinical notes.

Fusion Layer (Visionâ€“Language Model)

Combine image features + symptom embeddings.

Use cross-attention or multimodal transformers for joint reasoning.

Classifier Head

Fully connected layers with softmax/sigmoid for binary or multi-class detection (e.g., Endometriosis stage Iâ€“IV).

### 4. Training Procedure

Split dataset into train / validation / test.

Apply data augmentation for images (rotation, contrast adjustment) to improve robustness.

Train image encoder and language encoder separately, then fine-tune jointly.

Use loss functions:

Cross-entropy loss for classification.

Contrastive loss for aligning imageâ€“text pairs.

Optimization: Adam/AdamW with learning rate scheduling.

### 5. Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC.

Use confusion matrix to analyze false positives/negatives.

Compare performance of:

Image-only model

Symptom-only model

Full multimodal fusion (EndoScan-VLM).

### 6. Explainability

Apply Grad-CAM / attention maps to highlight image regions linked to diagnosis.

Display symptom contributions using attention weights from the language model.

Provide clinician-friendly reports (heatmaps + key symptom indicators).

### 7. Deployment

Develop a web/desktop interface for doctors:

Upload medical images.

Enter patient symptoms.

Get prediction + explanation (probability of endometriosis, stage, visual highlights).

Ensure privacy and compliance (HIPAA/GDPR if applicable).

### 8. Future Enhancements

Larger multimodal datasets (multi-center studies).

Incorporate blood biomarkers or genetic markers.

Transfer learning with general medical VLMs (like MedViLL, BioVLM).

Real-time clinical decision support system.

### ðŸ‘‰ In simple terms:

Step 1: Collect images + symptoms.

Step 2: Preprocess them.

Step 3: Build a dual-encoder model (image + text).

Step 4: Fuse both modalities.

Step 5: Train + evaluate.

Step 6: Add explainability + deploy.
