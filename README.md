TITLE: "ENDOSCAN-VLM: Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Detection"


## Procedure for EndoScan-VLM: Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Detection of Endometriosis
### 1. Problem Definition

Endometriosis diagnosis is often delayed due to reliance on invasive laparoscopy.

Aim: Build a multimodal AI system that uses medical images (ultrasound/MRI) and patient symptom data (clinical notes, questionnaires) for early, non-invasive detection.

### 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing

Medical Images:

Collect anonymized pelvic MRI/ultrasound images.

Preprocess: resize, normalize, remove noise, and annotate with clinical labels (endometriosis present/absent, staging).

Symptom Data:

Gather structured inputs (pain scale, menstrual cycle patterns, infertility history).

Convert into machine-readable format (numerical vectors or embeddings).

Textual Data (if available):

Extract clinical notes/diagnosis reports.

Use NLP to clean, tokenize, and convert into embeddings (BERT/ClinicalBERT).

### 3. Model Architecture

Image Encoder

Use CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet) or vision transformers (ViT, Swin-Transformer) for MRI/ultrasound feature extraction.

Language Encoder

Use pretrained transformer (BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT) for symptom text and clinical notes.

Fusion Layer (Vision–Language Model)

Combine image features + symptom embeddings.

Use cross-attention or multimodal transformers for joint reasoning.

Classifier Head

Fully connected layers with softmax/sigmoid for binary or multi-class detection (e.g., Endometriosis stage I–IV).

### 4. Training Procedure

Split dataset into train / validation / test.

Apply data augmentation for images (rotation, contrast adjustment) to improve robustness.

Train image encoder and language encoder separately, then fine-tune jointly.

Use loss functions:

Cross-entropy loss for classification.

Contrastive loss for aligning image–text pairs.

Optimization: Adam/AdamW with learning rate scheduling.

### 5. Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC.

Use confusion matrix to analyze false positives/negatives.

Compare performance of:

Image-only model

Symptom-only model

Full multimodal fusion (EndoScan-VLM).

### 6. Explainability

Apply Grad-CAM / attention maps to highlight image regions linked to diagnosis.

Display symptom contributions using attention weights from the language model.

Provide clinician-friendly reports (heatmaps + key symptom indicators).

### 7. Deployment

Develop a web/desktop interface for doctors:

Upload medical images.

Enter patient symptoms.

Get prediction + explanation (probability of endometriosis, stage, visual highlights).

Ensure privacy and compliance (HIPAA/GDPR if applicable).

### 8. Future Enhancements

Larger multimodal datasets (multi-center studies).

Incorporate blood biomarkers or genetic markers.

Transfer learning with general medical VLMs (like MedViLL, BioVLM).

Real-time clinical decision support system.

### 👉 In simple terms:

Step 1: Collect images + symptoms.

Step 2: Preprocess them.

Step 3: Build a dual-encoder model (image + text).

Step 4: Fuse both modalities.

Step 5: Train + evaluate.

Step 6: Add explainability + deploy.

# **EndoScan-VLM**  
*Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Detection of Endometriosis Using Medical Images and Symptom Data*  

---

## 📌 Introduction  
Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological condition where endometrium-like tissue grows outside the uterus, leading to severe pain, infertility, and delayed diagnosis. Current diagnostic methods rely heavily on invasive laparoscopy, with an average delay of 7–10 years before patients receive a proper diagnosis.  

**EndoScan-VLM** is a research prototype that leverages **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** to integrate **medical imaging (MRI/ultrasound scans)** with **patient symptom data**. By fusing these two modalities, the system aims to provide **non-invasive, AI-assisted early detection** of endometriosis.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a multimodal deep learning model that processes **medical images** and **symptom embeddings**.  
- Improve detection accuracy compared to image-only or symptom-only models.  
- Provide **explainable AI outputs** (heatmaps + symptom importance) for clinical trust.  
- Explore the potential of **non-invasive, rapid diagnosis** of endometriosis.  

---

## 🧩 Methodology
### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Images**: MRI/Ultrasound scans of pelvis. Preprocessing includes resizing, denoising, and augmentation.  
- **Symptoms**: Pain scale, cycle length, infertility history → encoded using NLP (BERT/ClinicalBERT).  
- **Labels**: Endometriosis present/absent, staging I–IV.  

### 2. Model Architecture
- **Image Encoder**: ResNet / EfficientNet / Vision Transformer.  
- **Language Encoder**: BERT / BioBERT / ClinicalBERT.  
- **Fusion Layer**: Cross-attention mechanism to align visual + symptom features.  
- **Classifier Head**: Fully connected layers → Softmax output.  

### 3. Training
- Optimizer: Adam/AdamW.  
- Loss: Cross-entropy + contrastive loss.  
- Split: Train (70%), Validation (15%), Test (15%).  

### 4. Evaluation
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
- Baseline comparisons:  
  - Image-only model.  
  - Symptom-only model.  
  - **EndoScan-VLM multimodal fusion** (expected best).  

### 5. Explainability
- **Grad-CAM heatmaps** for visualizing affected regions in MRI/Ultrasound.  
- **Attention weights** to highlight most relevant symptoms.  
- Generates clinician-friendly diagnostic reports.
